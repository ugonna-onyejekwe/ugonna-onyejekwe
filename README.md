# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ugonna Onyejekwe

I'm a Senior Frontend Developer with a deep passion for creating seamless, responsive, and scalable web experiences that genuinely serve users. Currently, I lead the frontend team at Olivia Stores, where Iâ€™m responsible for shaping the architecture of our web applications, driving development standards, and mentoring other engineers. 

My day-to-day work involves transforming complex product ideas into intuitive interfaces using React, Next.js, and TypeScript. I pay strong attention to performance, accessibility, and design consistency, ensuring that every component we build is reusable, maintainable, and aligned with our long-term goals. Beyond writing code, I work closely with designers, backend developers, and product managers to bridge the gap between vision and executionâ€”making sure every feature we deliver not only works but feels right to the user. I care about quality, teamwork, and building solutions that help people and businesses succeed.
