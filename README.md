# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ugonna Onyejekwe

A **Senior Frontend Developer** with a strong focus on building high-performance, scalable, and user-centered web applications. I currently lead the frontend team at **Olivia Stores**, where Iâ€™m responsible for architecting and implementing modern interfaces that power our business solutions.

In my role, I design and manage the structure of complex frontend systems using **React**, **Next.js**, and **TypeScript**, ensuring every product we ship is clean, maintainable, and optimized for performance. I lead code reviews, mentor junior developers, and collaborate closely with backend engineers and designers to deliver seamless user experiences. I also take ownership of building and maintaining our shared component libraries, enforcing best practices across the codebase, and continuously improving the overall frontend architecture. My daily work is centered around turning business needs into intuitive, responsive, and accessible interfaces that scale with our users.
